# Clustermode full = full mesh topology, every device is connected to every other device
# Clustermode loop = circle topology, devices are connected in a loop
# Clustermode single = line topology, basically loop mode with a cut in it
# Clustermode hubspoke = hub-and-spoke topology, every device is connected to one central device

# Connmode full = full mesh topology, every device in one cluster is connected to every device in the other cluster
# Connmode single = a single cable is applied between ONE PAIR of devices from both clusters
# Connmode exhaust = multiple cables are applied between PARALLEL PAIRS of devices from both clusters until the smallest cluster is exhausted
